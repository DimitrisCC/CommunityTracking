Sampling: uniform_p=0.7, min_replies=130, max_replies=16000, max_p=0.1, user_min=8, user_threshold=5, min_replies_week=5,
 min_degree=1

Combination of previous sampling methods:
	Uniform sampling -> Removing overly active and inactive subreddits + removing subreddits of a week with less than 5
	 replies considering them inactive -> Removing inactive users or their noisy activity
