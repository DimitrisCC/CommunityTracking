	scikit-tensor is a Python module for multilinear algebra and tensor factorizations. Currently, scikit-tensor supports basic tensor operations such as folding/unfolding, tensor-matrix and tensor-vector products as well as the following tensor factorizations:

	 - Canonical / Parafac Decomposition
	 - Tucker Decomposition
	 - RESCAL
	 - DEDICOM
	 - INDSCAL

	Moreover, all operations support dense and tensors.
